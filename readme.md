## Firebase REST SDK Todo Sample

<font color="red">WARNING: THIS SAMPLE DOESN'T WORK</font>


This is an attempt to use the Firebase REST SDK but it does not work with the way the user auth works for this sample.  It keeps getting permission denied messages.

For a working sample with firebase, see the firebase-web directory.  


This example uses Backand for the Data Store and REST APIs.
